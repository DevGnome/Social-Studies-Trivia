## Description
This is a simple frontend that accesses data from the OpenTDB public api. There is an option of choosing questions from 4 categories: History, Mythology, Geography and Politics. A button for each category is displayed and when clicked will render a question.

Guesses can be attempted until the correct answer is chosen. Choosing an answer will display a message stating whether the chosen answer is incorrect or correct. When the correct answer is chosen, a button will be enabled that opens a Google Search of the question in a new tab for more information. 

## Question Information
* Only 1 question will be displayed
